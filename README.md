This project was prepared as an assisting program for a tabletop roleplaying game, Warhammer Fantasy Roleplay (2nd edition) (Copyright: Games Workshop Limited). To fully comprehend the program, one must be somewhat aqcuainted with the rules of the system, or at least have some roleplaying game experience. The purpose of the program is to provide quick information on characters and non-player characters in the game. This includes all the stats required for gameplay. There is also a chance to keep track of the health of the characters and write comments freely. The game is intended for use of the game master, who can open the character windows of all players at once on a screen visible to the players, while opening the character windows of any enemies or NPCs on his own screen.

Quick instructions for use:

The main window provides the options to quick-create a new character, load an existing character, or exit the program (closing all open character sheets).

The character window:

The name, race, career, and attributes of the character can be changed by double-clicking on them. Weapons can be selected from a drop-down menu, and automatically show the damage they do. Perception and the top 9 skills of the character are always displayed, with their respective levels, on the main character window. Hovering your mouse over a skill will provide information on any talents that the character has learned that have an effect on the skill.

The Next Day button will heal the character by 1 wound if the character already has 3 wounds or more (= not heavily wounded). The Save function works and should save any and all information required.

The Skills-window allows you to choose the level of training for skills for a character. All basic skills can be used by anyone at half their related attribute's level, which can be clearly seen by the number next to them instead of the '-' next to unlearned advanced skills. Double-clicking on a skill will provide additional information.

The Talents-window allows you to choose the talents of a character. Hovering the mouse over a talent provides some information on what the talent will affect, whether it be a skill, an attribute, or weapon damage. Double-clicking a talent will provide the full description of the talent.

The area to the left allows the allocation of Armour Points to different hit areas, as well as showing the dice rolls required to hit each area. The Critical Hit Tables have not yet been implemented.
